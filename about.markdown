Welcome! It's nice to meet you. My name is Minsu, and I am a Go Developer, 
a Cybersecurity professional, and a homelab enthusiast. 
This is the site where I will post about various projects, tutorials, and
my resume, for recruiters.

Feel free to take a gander. If you have any questions, I take questions 
and comments at <a href="me@minsu.digital">me@minsu.digital</a>.
